# BetterPS-Safari

# QoL Features
This extension adds even more to the navigation bar, including a Skript Directory option! Allowing for less inconvenience whilst you update Skript files.

BetterPS also changes the way the Dashboard looks and feels, removing the clumpiness and making everything readable!

The website is now hard coded into dark mode! If you wish to use light mode that feature is not added yet! If more people ask for it, we shall give.
